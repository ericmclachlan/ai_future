### Part 1:

I've been given an opportunity to present a topic at a local technical conference. Accepted topics are broad but technically focused.

I'm looking for a title, but I think I know broadly what I want to say. Here are some points I'm wanting to cover but it's very chaotic. I'm not looking for suggestions on flow. I'm looking for your opinion on the emotional content for a Canadian audience.

- A little bit of background presented by the host.
- I was born as a white South African during apartheid. Apartheid ended 3 years before I finished high school. My father told me, "Are you going to go to university? Because previously, you could get a job like mine and work your way up. But now, for every guy like you, there's going to be 8 other guys looking for the same job."
- How do you survive in this?
- The IT industry has a high barrier to entry.
- This marriage of strategic decision making, opportunity, and ability allowed me to survive.
- I worked a software engineer for 9 years or so on all kinds of things.

Then, I spent 5 years teaching English in Japan. This was a wonderful opportunity for me - a South African white male - to be a true economic minority for the first time in my life. I learned what it was like to live in a country where people didn't speak my language as a way of making their voices heard.
While I was in Japan, I completed a BA in Linguistics, which opened my eyes to a new way of seeing the world. Equality, prejudice, discrimination, perception, emotion, wellness.... . These were concepts mostly missing from my computer science degree. It also reinforced my love for language... beautiful, complicated, messy, language.

But, in the meantime, South Africa continued to slide in an electricity crisis. I'd reached a plateau of career growth in Japan and was unlikely to ascend much further. I wanted a future for my family that teaching English could not afford. How could I survive and thrive? 
MA Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. Distance-based education, at a US institution leading to a Masters degree. Perfect for immigration to the USA.
I studied a 1 year master over the next 5 years while looking after my son or while working to support my family, now back in South Africa.

While studying, my work building English text classifiers became a stepping stone to working at Echosec, where I built text classifiers capable to processing a chunk of the worlds social media. Geolocation, toponym resolution. I led many of the technical aspects of solving these problems.

Enter LLMs. I realized quickly that, while there are some companies that required NLP specialists, there's a lot of NLP problems that a LLM can solve. Sentiment, text summarization, etc. How do I survive in this changing landscape. My master's degree was instrumental but how do I survive now?

"Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable," said Huang, 62, whose $3.3 trillion company designs some of the computer chips that power popular AI tools. "You're not going to lose your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to someone who uses AI."

So, now I'm working in AI at Revela. A machine learning and AI software services company.

And, I've never felt so vulnerable to threats to my livelihood.

AI is increasingly taking over aspects of my work. How do we survive as software engineers? Do we ignore the problem and hope it goes away? Of course not. But there's a kind of complacency in industry that is startling. 

I think many software engineers are like the masons guild of long ago. People, skilled a particular skillset, employed to build churches, cathedrals, and castles. People whose craft deeply impacted society. They were artists and craftsmen.
Likewise, software engineering has until now had a similar profile: People with certain neural and aesthetic qualities that made us a good fit for the industry. And we're struggling as an industry because AI is taking a bit of the art out of the software engineering. Builders still exist of course, but it's vastly different form the work of the masons. And I think software engineering is about to experience a similar shift. And some software engineers are going to discover that they've always really enjoyed the art of software engineering.

Personally, I want to put the brakes on the advancement of AI. I don't want the negative externalities: The pollution, the chaos, the virtual relationships, the AI voice that are increasingly becoming the lingua franca of our time.

On the other hand, I need to survive in this new world. 
AI scales. AI helps ME scale.
I'm more impactful through the use of agents. I have code for generating my pull request descriptions. I have code for framing my contributions to code in a way that makes sense to clients. I have code for running the initial code review of other people's work. I'm not a 10x engineer. Not yet. But maybe I can be a 2x engineer. If 
so, I'm half the price of someone else. That's a lot of discounted value to bake into my position in the market.

### "The Privilege of Non-Violence"

One night, I was having a beer at a fire pit where one naval officer and an ex-naval officer were talking. The ex-naval officer was advocating for non-violence. The other was stating that the contribution of the military stabilizes societies. I was mostly quiet. When asked my opinion, I said that in my view, non-violence is a privilege. It's evidence that you are safe enough without violence to be non-violent. But I've been at a shopping mall when shots were fired. More than once. I've been the person to answer a knock on the front door where a man stood, with wrists bruised where he'd been bound in his own home.

My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival.

AI is an existential threat to my career and possible to society itself. I wonder if people have an assumption of safety around this blinding us to the threat at the door.

In order to remain competitive, I have to adopt AI to survive as a software engineer. I feel more of a sense of urgency around this than at any other time in my life.

This is the worst that AI is going to be. And we need to talk about how we're going to do that.

- Agentic AI and how can be leveraged to accelerate the delivery of software solutions.
- Do we finally need to rethink code as text files?
- Do we need to document for AI?
- How do we manage AI-generated code and make it maintainable?


### Part 2

One thing I'd like to add is the acknowledgement that AI as an idea is a fierce ethical battlefield. Both in the foreground where we're talking about the impact of AI training on the environment, representation of minorities in the training data, potential violation of copyright, accessibility and more. But in the background, as we approach building AI systems that become superhuman, or novel enough to innovate knowledge... this becomes a national security issue. It's not unimaginable that in this case, the first to reach the crest of the hill will be able to continue any advantage indefinitely.
