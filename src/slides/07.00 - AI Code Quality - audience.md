# AI-Generated Code Quality

**The Good:**
- Fast generation
- Sanity check

**The Bad:**
- Misaligned with coding standards
- Stack incompatibility
- Requires vague language iteration
- Clunky interfaces
- Quality issues (AI is WIP)

**The Challenge:** AI is antithetical to what attracts people to software engineering.
