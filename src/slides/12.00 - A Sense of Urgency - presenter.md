# A Sense of Urgency

- Share your personal urgency around AI's impact
- Contrast with the resistance you see in others

## The Disconnect

- "I feel a sense of tremendous personal urgency around the idea of AI and its impact on Software Development as a profession. 
- But, I don't feel that urgency in the people around me."

> Why is there a disconnect between the **personal urgency** I feel and the **resistance** I perceive in industry? 

## The Resistance
- **Strong resistance** to AI adoption
- May be related to **alienation** from aspects that drew us to software engineering
