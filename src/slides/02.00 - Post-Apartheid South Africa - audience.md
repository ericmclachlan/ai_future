# Post-Apartheid South Africa

**The Challenge:**
> "For every middle class job where someone like you would apply, there will now be 8 other guys applying for the same job."

**The Response:**
- Personal aptitude for technology
- High barrier to entry in IT industry
- Strategic decision making + opportunity + ability = survival

*This created an intentionality around survival that has shaped my entire career approach.*
