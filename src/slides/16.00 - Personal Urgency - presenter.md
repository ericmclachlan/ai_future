# Personal Urgency

- Share your personal urgency around AI's impact
- Contrast with the resistance you see in others

## The Disconnect
> "I feel a tremendous personal urgency around the idea of AI and its impact on Software Development as a profession. But I don't feel that urgency in the people around me."

## The Resistance
- **Strong resistance** to AI adoption
- May be related to **alienation** from aspects that drew us to software engineering

## Key Quote
> "My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival."

## Question
Why the disconnect between **personal urgency** and **industry resistance**?
