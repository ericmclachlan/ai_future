# "The Privilege of Non-Violence"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Share the naval officers conversation
- Explain your perspective on non-violence as privilege
- Connect to AI safety assumptions

**From initial_thoughts.md:**
"In my view, non-violence is a privilege. It's evidence that you are safe enough without violence to be non-violent."

**The AI Ethics Battlefield:**
- Training costs (financial and environmental)
- Training data sourcing and transparency
- Impact on artists and creators

**Key Point:** In safe societies like Canada, there's an assumption of safety that may blind us to threats.

# Personal Urgency vs. Industry Resistance

**Presenter Notes:**
- Share your personal urgency around AI's impact
- Contrast with the resistance you see in others

**From initial_thoughts.md:**
"I feel a tremendous personal urgency around the idea of AI and its impact on Software Development as a profession. But I don't feel that urgency in the people around me."

**The Resistance:**
- Strong resistance to AI adoption
- May be related to alienation from aspects that drew us to software engineering

**Key Quote:** "My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival."

**Question:** Why the disconnect between personal urgency and industry resistance?

```markdown:src/slides/11.00 - Worst AI Will Ever Be - presenter.md
# "This is the Worst the AI Will Ever Be..."

**Presenter Notes:**
- Emphasize this critical point
- Ask: What does this mean for our industry?

**The Implications:**
- We need to broaden our minds about what makes a good engineer
- Opportunity for more inclusivity
- Need tolerance for different approaches and people

**The Challenge:** Traditional software engineering qualities may not be the most valuable in an AI-augmented world.

**Key Point:** This is our chance to redefine what makes a good engineer.

```markdown:src/slides/12.00 - BC and AGI - presenter.md
# British Columbia, Canada and AGI

**Presenter Notes:**
- Share the AI 2027 predictions
- Show the compute comparison
- Do the napkin math for BC's electricity

**AI 2027 Predictions:**
- GPT-3: 3 × 10²³ FLOP
- GPT-4: 2 × 10²⁵ FLOP  
- Agent-1: 4 × 10²⁷ FLOP

**BC Electricity Math:**
- 4 × 10²⁷ FLOPs = 4 × 10¹⁶ joules
- Would take ~18.5% of BC's annual electricity

**Opportunities:**
- Secure beneficial terms for model access
- ~$800 million CAD in electricity trade revenue
- Avoid 2.6 million tonnes of CO₂

**Key Point:** BC has unique opportunities in the AI future.

Now I need to update the slides.js to handle the new file structure:

```javascript:src/slides.js
// Dynamic slide loader
const slideModules = import.meta.glob('./slides/*.md', { as: 'raw' });

async function loadSlides() {
  const slideFiles = Object.keys(slideModules);
  
  // Group files by slide number and type
  const slideGroups = {};
  
  for (const file of slideFiles) {
    const match = file.match(/\.\/slides\/(\d+\.\d+)\s*-\s*(.+?)\s*-\s*(presenter|audience)\.md$/);
    if (match) {
      const [, number, title, type] = match;
      if (!slideGroups[number]) {
        slideGroups[number] = { number, title, presenter: '', audience: '' };
      }
      slideGroups[number][type] = file;
    }
  }
  
  // Sort by slide number and load content
  const sortedSlides = Object.values(slideGroups)
    .sort((a, b) => parseFloat(a.number) - parseFloat(b.number));
  
  const slides = [];
  
  for (const slide of sortedSlides) {
    const presenterContent = await slideModules[slide.presenter]();
    const audienceContent = await slideModules[slide.audience]();
    
    slides.push([presenterContent, audienceContent]);
  }
  
  return slides;
}

// Export a promise that resolves to the slides
export default loadSlides();
```

This creates a comprehensive slide deck that follows the presentation outline from `presenter_notes.md`, incorporating content from `initial_thoughts.md` and creating a logical flow from personal narrative to industry implications to local opportunities.
