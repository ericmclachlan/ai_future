# How AI is Changing the Way I Write Software

### The Good

- PR Descriptions
- Code Review
- Cursor Agents
- Unit Test generation

### The Bad

- Being plain wrong - or at least not good enough.
- "Hallucinations"?

### The Ugly

- The interface?
- "Good enough'ism"
- Can I justify the code I submit to my code reviewer?
- Getting stuck in the AI's loop
- Being driven somewhere vs driving somewhere.
