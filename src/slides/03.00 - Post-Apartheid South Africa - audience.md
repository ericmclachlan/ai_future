# Post-Apartheid South Africa

## My Father's Council

> Are you going to go to university? Because previously, you could start at the bottom and **work your way up**. But, now, **every step of the way, there will be 8 other people competing against you** for the same job.

## Why did I choose software development?

- **Personal aptitude** for technology
- **High barrier to entry** in IT industry
- **Strategic decision making** + opportunity + ability = survival

*This created an intentionality around survival that has shaped my entire career approach.*
