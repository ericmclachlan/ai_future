# The Privilege of Non-Violence

> "Non-violence is a privilege. It's evidence that you are safe enough without violence to be non-violent."

Recently, I was having a **beer at a fire** pit where one naval officer and an ex-naval officer were talking. The ex-naval officer was advocating for non-violence. The other was stating that the contribution of the military stabilizes societies. 

I was mostly quiet. 

When asked my opinion, I said that in my view, **non-violence is a privilege**.
**It's evidence that you are safe enough without violence to be non-violent.**

But I've been at a shopping mall when shots were fired. More than once.
I've been the person to answer a knock on my front door to be greeted by a man with wrists bruised where he'd been bound in his own home.

My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival.
