# Surviving the Shifts: From Apartheid to an AI Future

## Presenter Notes
- Introduce yourself
- Set the tone: this is a personal reflection, not a technical deep-dive
- Mention this is about **survival**, **culture**, and **AI**
- Acknowledge the weight of the topic

## Key Quote
> "My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival."

## Question
Why the disconnect between urgency and resistance?

```markdown:src/slides/11.00 - Worst AI Will Ever Be - presenter.md
# "This is the Worst the AI Will Ever Be..."

## Presenter Notes
- Emphasize this critical point
- Ask: What does this mean for our industry?

## The Implications
- We need to broaden our minds about what makes a good engineer
- Opportunity for more inclusivity
- Need tolerance for different approaches and people

## The Challenge
Traditional software engineering qualities may not be the most valuable in an AI-augmented world.

## Key Point
This is our chance to redefine what makes a good engineer.

```markdown:src/slides/12.00 - BC and AGI - presenter.md
# British Columbia, Canada and AGI

## Presenter Notes
- Share the AI 2027 predictions
- Show the compute comparison
- Do the napkin math for BC's electricity

## AI 2027 Predictions
- GPT-3: 3 × 10²³ FLOP
- GPT-4: 2 × 10²⁵ FLOP  
- Agent-1: 4 × 10²⁷ FLOP

## BC Electricity Math
- 4 × 10²⁷ FLOPs = 4 × 10¹⁶ joules
- Would take ~18.5% of BC's annual electricity

## Opportunities
- Secure beneficial terms for model access
- ~$800 million CAD in electricity trade revenue
- Avoid 2.6 million tonnes of CO₂

## Key Point
BC has unique opportunities in the AI future.

Now I need to update the slides.js to handle the new file structure:

```javascript:src/slides.js
// Dynamic slide loader
const slideModules = import.meta.glob('./slides/*.md', { as: 'raw' });

async function loadSlides() {
  const slideFiles = Object.keys(slideModules);
  
  // Group files by slide number and type
  const slideGroups = {};
  
  for (const file of slideFiles) {
    const match = file.match(/\.\/slides\/(\d+\.\d+)\s*-\s*(.+?)\s*-\s*(presenter|audience)\.md$/);
    if (match) {
      const [, number, title, type] = match;
      if (!slideGroups[number]) {
        slideGroups[number] = { number, title, presenter: '', audience: '' };
      }
      slideGroups[number][type] = file;
    }
  }
  
  // Sort by slide number and load content
  const sortedSlides = Object.values(slideGroups)
    .sort((a, b) => parseFloat(a.number) - parseFloat(b.number));
  
  const slides = [];
  
  for (const slide of sortedSlides) {
    const presenterContent = await slideModules[slide.presenter]();
    const audienceContent = await slideModules[slide.audience]();
    
    slides.push([presenterContent, audienceContent]);
  }
  
  return slides;
}

// Export a promise that resolves to the slides
export default loadSlides();
```

This creates a comprehensive slide deck that follows the presentation outline from `presenter_notes.md`, incorporating content from `initial_thoughts.md` and creating a logical flow from personal narrative to industry implications to local opportunities.
