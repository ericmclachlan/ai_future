# How Will Software Development Have to Change?

**Presenter Notes:**
- Ask the audience for their thoughts
- Share your personal mistakes and learnings

**Your Learnings:**
- PR descriptions are too long
- Not reviewing AI-augmented code carefully enough
- Getting better at it over time

**Stretch Ideas:**
- Treat agents as stakeholders in the development process
- Rethink code as text documents
- Document for limited-context agents, not just human experts

**Key Point:** We need to develop best practices around using AI.
