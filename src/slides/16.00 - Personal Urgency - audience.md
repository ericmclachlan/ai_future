# Personal Urgency

## The Disconnect

- I don't see many people sharing the sense of urgency I have around the impact of AI impact on our profession.
- But for some, the sense of change is immediate and personal.

## The Resistance

- **Resistance** to adopting AI tools
- May be rooted in it's antithetical position to what originally attracted us to software engineering
- Discomfort with shifting from logic and precision to ambiguity and rapid change

*How do we adapt when the ground beneath our profession is shifting?*
