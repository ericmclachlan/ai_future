# Personal Urgency

## The Disconnect

- I feel a sense of urgency
- Do you?

## The Resistance

- **Resistance** to adopting AI tools
- May be rooted in it's antithetical position to what originally attracted us to software engineering
- Discomfort with shifting from logic and precision to ambiguity and rapid change
