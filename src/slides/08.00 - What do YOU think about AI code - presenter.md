# What do YOU think about AI code?

- Ask audience to be **specific** about deficiencies
- Guide discussion toward these points:

## The Good
- Code is generated **quickly**
- Provides **sanity check**

## The Bad
- Doesn't align with **coding standards**
- Doesn't align with our **stack**
- Requires iteration with **vague language**
- **Clunky interfaces**
- Quality not good enough (**AI is WIP**)

## The Challenge

Are these problems with using AI?
Are they problems with using AI today?
Are they problems that can be managed?

## A Gnawing Question (Not an "annoying question")

Is AI **antithetical** to what attracts people to software engineering:
 - conversation with bots, 
 - vague language,
 - unclear norms and processes.
