# How AI is Changing the Way I Write Software

> **I really only care about outcomes.**
- I'm not a purist
- I work in services - clients want good, fast, and cheap. We try to give them 2/3.

### The Good

- PR Descriptions
- Code Review
- Cursor
  - Agents in full Auto mode!
  - Memories
- Unit Test generation
  - Helps the AI focus

### The Bad

- Being plain wrong - or at least not good enough.
- "Hallucinations"?

### The Ugly

- The interface?
- "Good enough'ism"
  - I need to careful review **AI-augmented code**
- Can I justify the code I submit to my code reviewer?
- Getting stuck in the AI's loop
- Being driven somewhere vs driving somewhere
  - Are we giving up our expertise?
