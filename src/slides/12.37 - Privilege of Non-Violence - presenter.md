# The Privilege of Non-Violence

```
Recently, I was having a **beer at a fire** pit where one naval officer and an ex-naval officer were talking.
The ex-naval officer was advocating for non-violence.
The naval officer was defending the position that the military provides a stabilizing force.

I was mostly quiet. 

When asked my opinion I said that, in my view, **non-violence is a privilege**.
**It's evidence that you are safe enough without violence to be non-violent.**

But... I've been at a shopping mall when shots were fired.
I've been the person to answer the front door;
greeted by a man with wrists bruised from where he'd been bound in his own home.

My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival.
