# How AI is Changing the Way I Write Software

### The Good

- PR Descriptions
- Code Review (first pass)
  - I apply this to my own PRs.
  - I apply this to other people's PRs.
- Cursor
  - Agents in full Auto mode!
  - Memories
- Unit Test generation
  - Helps the AI focus

### The Bad

- "Hallucinations"?
- Being plain wrong - or at least not good enough.

### The Ugly

- Good enough'ism
  - I need to careful review **AI-augmented code**
- Can I justify the code I submit to the code reviewer?
- Getting stuck in the AI's loop
- Being driven vs driving somewhere.
