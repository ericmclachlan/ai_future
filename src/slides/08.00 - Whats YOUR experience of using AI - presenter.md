# What's YOUR experience of using AI?

- Ask audience to be **specific** about deficiencies
- Guide discussion toward these points:

### The Good

- Code is generated **quickly**
- Provides **sanity check**
- **Agents** give us hope of automating basic intelligence
- It's relatively cheap.

### The Bad
- Doesn't align with **coding standards**
- Doesn't align with our **stack**
- Requires iteration with **vague language**
- **Clunky interfaces**
- Quality not good enough (**AI is WIP**)

### The Challenge

- Are these problems with using AI?
- Are they problems with using AI **TODAY**?
- Are they problems that can be managed? Possibly with more AI?

### A Gnawing Question (Not an "annoying question")

**Your Homework: Self-reflection**

Is AI **antithetical** to what attracts people to software engineering:
 - conversation with bots, 
 - vague language,
 - unclear norms and processes.
