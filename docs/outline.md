# Surviving AI as a Software Engineer

This document defines the outline of a presentation at the "VIATEC AI Meetup: (Technology Track)" - a bi-monthly event attended by technology professionals with an interest in artificial intelligence. 

Title: Surviving the Shifts: From Apartheid to an AI Future
Description: A personal reflection on the urgent, uneasy coexistence of survival, culture, and artificial intelligence.

## Presentation Outline

- Narrative Arc #1: Starting a Career in Post-Apartheid South Africa
  - My father said, "For every middle class job where someone like you would apply, there will now be 8 other guys applying for the same job."
  - Relevance:
    - (Unspoken: Intentionality around survival)

- Ask Audience: What kinds of people does software development attract?
  - Relevance:
    - (Unspoken: While there is more inclusivity than when I started my career, there is still a "profile" that largely follows the nature of the work.)
    - Key attributes:
        - Logical
        - Analytical
        - Able to work in silence for hours at a time 
        - prefer the exactitude of mathematics to the vaguities of interpersonal conversation
        - High degree of abstract thinking ("self-documenting code")

- Narrative Arc #2: Went to Japan to teach English for 5 years.
    - Relevance:
    - I worked with someone who was very different from me.
    - Struggle with percentages.
    - I learned that while, I was effective at my job, I was a better team member when I stepped away from the profile of software engineer.
    - Software engineers still have a profile.
    - 

Narrative Arc #3: Segway back into technology via a Masters in Computational Linguistics.
    - Relevance:
        - (Unspoken: Intentionality around survival)
        - (Unspoken: Building connectivity to the audience through our software engineering)
        - NLP

- Ask Audience (3 members): How is AI affecting your work so far.
    - How do we realize the dream of "The 10x Engineer"? Or even the 2x Engineer?
    - Demonstrate: Summary of PRs agent
    - Demonstrate: Code Review agent


- Ask Audience: In general, what do you think about the the quality of code produced by AI so far?
    - Ask audience to be specific about the nature of deficiencies.
    - Good
        - Code is generated quickly.
        - Sanity check
    - Bad
        - Doesn't align well with our coding standard.
        - Doesn't align well with our stack
        - Requires iteration to get the AI to do what you want to do and this takes time.
        - Clunky interfaces
        - Natural language
        - The quality is not good enough. (i.e. AI is a WIP)
    - Relevance
        - In some surprising ways, AI is antithetical to what attracts people to software engineering
            - Conversation with a bot.
            - Iteration using vague language.
            - Deviation from our comfort zones (stack, coding standards).
        - Is this why we resist?
        - Maybe this is an opportunity for software development to become more inclusive
            - Maybe we can benefit from people who don't mind the vaguities and long conversations in natural language?

- Ask the Audience: How will Software Development have to change?
    - Some ideas:
        - We need to develop best practices around using AI.
            - I'm making mistakes. PR descriptions are too long.
            - I'm not reviewing AI-augmented code contributions carefully enough.
            - I'm not 
            - I'm getter better at it.
        - Stretch: We need to treat agents as a stakeholder in the software development process.
            - We may need to rethink how we write code. (Is a text document really the best we can do?)
            - We may need to document our code - not for produce experts - but for limited context agents to understand. 
    
- Narrative Arc: "The Privilege of Non-Violence" (see initial_thoughts.md)
    - In a safe society, like Canada, I worry that there's an assumption of safety.
    - The topic of AI is fiercely ethical.
        - Training cost financially and environmentally.
        - How training data is sourced and transparency around training data.
        - How artists are being impacted by the AI-generated art.

- "My world is a world of violence. And my life is a struggle for survival."

- I feel a tremendous personal urgency around the idea of AI and its impact on Software Development as a profession.
    - But I don't feel that urgency in the people around me.
    - I feel a strong resistance to the adoption of AI.
    - I think this may be related to an alienation from the aspects of the job that drew us to software development engineering in the first place.

- "This is the worst the AI will ever be..." 
    - What does this mean for our industry?
    - We need to broaden our mind about what qualities make a good engineer.
        - There's an opportunity for more inclusivity here.
        - But we need a kind of tolerance to the differences that other kinds of people and other approaches to solving problems will bring to the team.
        
- Stretch: British Columbia, Canada and AGI
    - "AI 2027"
        ![Illustration of Compute to train Agent-1](resources/compute.png)
        - [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com)
        - GPT-3 (3 x 10^23 FLOP)
        - GPT-4 (2 x 10^25 FLOP)
        - Agent-1 (4 x 10^27 FLOP)
    - British Columbia is a net exporter of electricity to the USA (but we import electricity from the USA as well)
    - Napkin math:
        - 4 × 10²⁷ FLOPs = 4 × 10¹⁶ joules
        - It would take ~18.5% of BC's annual electricity to power that many FLOPs on efficient hardware.
    - Opportunities
        - Secure beneficial terms for access to these models (most likely developed in the US)
        - Financial opportunity 
            - ~$800 million CAD in electricity trade revenue
            - avoid 2.6 million tonnes of CO₂

### "You won't lose your job to AI"

[CNBC: Nvidia CEO: You won’t lose your job to AI—you’ll ‘lose your job to somebody who uses AI’](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-youll-lose-your-job-to-somebody-who-uses-ai.html) 

> "Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable," said Huang, 62, whose $3.3 trillion company designs some of the computer chips that power popular AI tools. "You're not going to lose your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to someone who uses AI."

#### [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com)

> "We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like. It’s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes."
